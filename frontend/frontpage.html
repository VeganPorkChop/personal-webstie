            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a first year Mechanical Engineering student at Northwestern University. I’ve always been fascinated by how things work for as long as I can remember. From building small projects to solving technical problems, I’m driven by curiosity and creativity, and I’m always excited to turn ideas into real-world solutions through engineering. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "box">
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I love to play chess on my phone, recently school has taken all of my free time, but I still try to find time to play the best board game ever invented. </p>
            <p style = "margin-top: 10px;">I also love to play the piano and saxophone. I have played the piano for 12 years, and the saxophone for 8. I want to increase my music repertoire so that when people ask for proof of my musical abilities, I can show them more than just a few polished songs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "box">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>My short term goal is to get an internship in the engineering field for the summer of 2026. My long term goal is to graduate from Northwestern University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and work for myself. I have a couple patents that I am working on in hopes that they will change the world. When they're complete, I will add them here.</p>
